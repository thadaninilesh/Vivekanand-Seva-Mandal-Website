		<p>BHIWANDI: The local unit of DHL, the world leader in logistics and supply chain management, has helped Vivekanand Seva Mandal's educational work by donating pre-used computers under their CSR initiative in August 2014. VSM in turn has deployed select computers in its educational projects in rural and city areas, benefitting few hundred students by November 2014. </p> 

		<p>DHL, western region, having its large scale ware house in Bhiwandi, near Mumbai, has proactively helped educational outreach of VSM in urban neighborhood and rural schools. It has donated 27 pre-used PCs which were in sound condition and also provided logistical support to transport them to VSM office.</p>

	<div class="col-md-7 col-xs-8 col-sm-8" style="font-size:20px;">
		<p>VSM, being mainly an organisation run by technocrat volunteers, have been harnessing the prowess of information technology in the fields of social and charitable work. We will be among few voluntary organisations in India, who have been using IT systems to improve efficacy and efficiency of our work in the fields of education and tribal / rural development. </p>

		<p>After refurbishing / augmenting these systems, VSM has deployed about eight PCs at six government / municipal council run schools, hostels in the villages / city neighbourhood areas and two are deployed at our own library & study centre. </p>
		 
		<p>These 8 PCs will enable about 198 underprivileged students from urban neighbourhoods and village schools to learn and better their lives, while 2 PCs will ease transactions for approximately 450 numbers of students at our library and study centre. We thank entire team DHL (Bhiwandi & Western Region) for their generous donation. </p>
