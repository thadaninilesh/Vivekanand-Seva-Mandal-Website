                        <strong>ZEP (झेप)</strong> Educational Assistance Program.<br/>
						If you are supposed to climb a tough mountain ahead, will you be able to climb it without proper knowledge, fitness and a necessary support system?Same is the case of those underprivileged children who aspire to take higher education but are unable to perceive due to lack of wherewithal.
					</p>
					<p class="vsm-proeve-des">	
						As Mandal is working in rural areas for the upliftment of the underprivileged tribal kids, our one of the main priority is the Education.Most of the tribal are very poor &amp; living under Below Poverty Line (BPL), with a limited means of income. Most of them are dependent on agriculture and allied activities, which is not sufficient to take care of their livelihoods &amp; is uncertain.
						They can’t afford expenses for their children’s education due to poor economic conditions, even if the student is talented &amp; willing to learn. So Mandal has decided to work on this Educational Assistance Program. 
                    </p>
					<p class="vsm-proeve-des">
						We think that the support of parents to their wards is crucial for their educational development; hence we are ensuring active partenership of parents in this educational assistance program. We seek token (20%) financial involvement from these parents, wherever we provide 80% financial assistance towards fees &amp; other expenses of students. Also, we will involve them in the non-financial aspects of our assistance program. 
						There are 52 students who are taking benefits from our ZEP Educational Assistance Program during year 2014-15.
