				<p class="vsm-proeve-des">
				DnyanMandir provides students with a large library having good books and their very own ‘place of study’. Both of these facilities are proven catalysts to a student’s successful academic life. This was the first project of Mandal, conceived in 1991, for facilitating students enrolled in higher studies to secure the great educational journey and be inspired by the Swami Vivekananda’s clarion call to serve the society.
