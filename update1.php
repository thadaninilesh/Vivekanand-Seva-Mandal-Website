		<p>14th December, 2014</p>
		<p>Vihigaon, Kasara: Our teams along with our watershed development expert Dr. Umesh Mundlye visited Vihigaon to conduct an onsite survey. The main aim of the survey was to plan watershed management for Vihigaon so that water scarcity during summer can be addressed. </p>
		<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Working on the identified locations for precise marking of the points from where water leak.</li>
			<li>Finalizing the location & dimensions of the bund (partially above surface and mostly subsurface), which will help in retaining more water for more time period in the bund, stream and wells upstream.</li>
			<li>Possible reduction in our expenses for water conservation work.</li>
			<li>To check whether there is any need of subsurface bund which we have earlier decided to build.  </li>
		</ol>

		<p>Villagers had given information that there is no complete rock bed in the stream and water leaks through the cracks and fractures of the rock and any bund cannot be made leak proof.
		We worked with the help of villagers at one of the locations identified earlier & it seems that we have got good bed rock.</p>

		<p>Since, there were untimely rains a day before our visit; the water level & water flow in the stream was considerable. Hence we could not actually see the rock below 2 feet depth.</p>
		<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>We are planning our visit in the coming weeks to check condition of base rock.  For that we require dry stream.</li>
			<li>If everything goes well, we may have to build partially above surface and mostly subsurface bund.</li>
			<li>After that, we will plan to reconstruct well may be in May.</li>
