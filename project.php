                            Our lessons in community work were initiated by Swamiji’s above words of wisdom. We do not participate in social action or community work to make a fashion statement. Rather, it is an accepted way of life for us. We believe that we owe our debt to this society, nation and the world and we can work towards its betterment along with fellow youth.

                            Our projects are inspired by Swamiji’s teaching of “service to humanity is service to god.” All our projects and wings are manifestation of this philosophy. The genesis of several projects is based on one or the other teachings of Swami Vivekananda and is born out of necessities of various communities in which we work.

Our volunteers are our ambassadors who get enlightened by the joy of giving and spread it among their families, friends, colleagues and people. They do see an opportunity to build a connect between urban landscape as well as rural hinterland.
