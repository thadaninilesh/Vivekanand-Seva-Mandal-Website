						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Mandal donates audio-visual infrastructure to schools to provide entire audio-visual course content free of cost, so that school teachers can regularly use this e-classroom for their regular sessions.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Mandal conducts a weekly session in most participatory way to help students learn difficult most topics in a most congenial environment.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">The syllabus for our sessions is designed by our education experts from Dombivli, Pune and UK.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Dedication, passion and qualification of volunteers are the key strengths of Nalanda initiative.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Mandal’s volunteer-teachers engage with the students once a week, that help students unleash their hidden potential (general knowledge, communications etc.). The session encourages students to involve in participative learning which helps improve their motivation and commitment towards education.</p>
						</li>

				   <ul>
						
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Nalanda initiative started in the academic year 2013-14 at ZP school, Maanpada-Maangaon, Dombivli.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Mandal donated 40-inch TV set along with E-classroom software for 6th and 7th standard.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Mandal’s team conduct sessions at the school on every Saturday for 2 hours in order to engage the session for 7thstd students.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">The sessions imparted basic concepts of science and maths to students through audio-visual techniques.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="vsm-proeve-des">General knowledge, soft-skills development were some of the crucial topics of session delivery. </p>
					<p class="vsm-proeve-des"><strong>Achievements:</strong>Within a very short span of time, the school teachers gave us the feedback:<strong>“Handwriting of students has improved. The clarity of thoughts is visible in their exam papers”.</strong> By the end of the academic year, the students seemed to be more confident and bold in public speaking.</p>
					<h2 class="sub-head">Phase II</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">Emboldened by our success of phase 1, Mandal decided to expand this initiative to 2 more schools in and around Dombivli.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="vsm-proeve-des">We aim to achieve more encouraging performance from students of these schools through quality in session delivery, passion and dedication. Below is a list of Nalanda units that we started for 2014-15.</p>
						</li>
						<li><p class="vsm-proeve-des">Zilla Parishad School – Mangaon-Manpada – State Govt. run school (Continued since 2012-13)

				<p class="vsm-proeve-des">To monitor the effectiveness of Nalanda Initiative, Mandal designed a framework based on which, the performance is measured. Following are the major parameters to check the performance of students as well as effectiveness of this project:
				<ul>
					<li><p class="vsm-proeve-des" >Quality improvement in students’ basic skills (Reading, writing, speaking)</p></li>
					<li><p class="vsm-proeve-des">Personality improvement of students &amp; higher motivation to continue the education. The last aspect is important as most of the children from the city neighbourhoods have  challenged family background.</p></li>
					<li><p class="vsm-proeve-des">Help teachers adopt participatory approach, and audio-visual techniques</p></li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote><p class="vsm-proeve-des"><strong>Swami Vivekananda dreamt of imparting man-making education to the masses. We at Vivekananda Seva Mandal are taking small steps in realising that noble dream through NALANDA initiative.</strong></p>
				<p class="vsm-proeve-des">We appeal for your sincere help for the same. Together we can create a great education culture that was once a part of India’s history, as epitomised by the ancient university of Nalanda.</p></blockquote>
